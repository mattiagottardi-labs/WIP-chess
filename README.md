## WIP-chess
This project aims to become a fully functioning multiplayer chess board to play with your friends. This has been in development for ~3h. I am not rushing and the main objective is to learn object oriented programming in C++ as well as implementing UI.

## Current state:

So far the logic is 70% there. The pieces know what their scope is and the functions are there to move and kill pieces, as well as to promote pawns. Enpassant and Castling will be implemented soon. The next things to implement are, in order:

-missing logic (enpassant, castling, check, checkmate, stall).

-UI
