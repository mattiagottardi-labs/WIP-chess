## WIP-chess
This project has gone through a complete rewrite and is now fully working and much simplified. 90% of the code is commented and very easily understandable with the necessary context (knowing how chess works). 

You should be able to compile this and run it with these commands in powershell, after opening the folder:

g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp gameState.cpp player.cpp piece.cpp -o chess.exe

## Current state:

IT ALL WORKS. it need a UI tho.
