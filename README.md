## WIP-chess
This project has gone through a complete rewrite and is now fully working and much simplified. 90% of the code is commented and very easily understandable with the necessary context (knowing how chess works). 

I have implemented the UI and adjusted some features to make it feel good to play. It would still require further work to make it online and would require a server to run across different devices, but it's a project i consider complete for now.

###   !!! !!! .EXE WORKS FOR WINDOWS ONLY !!! !!!

## FINAL THOUGHTS 
This has been amazing to work on and has engaged me a lot all throughout. I hope to come up with the time to work on more projects later down the line.
